        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">Swifties lost their minds when the 10-minute version "from the vault" was announced, then went wild again when it actually dropped last week. Not only is the song much longer, it features a number of new lyrics that pretty much prove what we’ve been saying all along: this song is about <span><em>Jake Gyllenhaal</em></span>. We’ll talk about that more in a minute.
            The re-release is also important because it’s a “Taylor’s Version”, meaning she actually owns this version of the track. The original recording from the 2012 version of Red currently belongs to Shamrock Holdings, an American private equity firm owned by the Disney estate, after Scooter Braun sold the masters to Taylor’s first six albums in 2020. In a bid to finally own her own work, which many music artists sadly don’t, Taylor announced she’d be re-recording and releasing her first six albums. She started with Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and followed up with Red (Taylor’s Version), both in 2021.

        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">The re-release is also important because it’s a “Taylor’s Version”, meaning she actually owns this version of the track. The original recording from the 2012 version of <span><em>Red</em></span> currently belongs to Shamrock Holdings, an American private equity firm owned by the Disney estate, after Scooter Braun sold the masters to Taylor’s first six albums in 2020.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">In a bid to finally own her own work, which many music artists sadly don’t, Taylor announced she’d be re-recording and releasing her first six albums. She started with <span></span><em>Fearless (Taylor’s Version)</em></span> and followed up with <span><em>Red (Taylor’s Version)</em></span>, both in 2021.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">Alright, let’s get into the juicy stuff. Taylor has said that she wrote most of the lyrics to the 10-minute version of <span><em>All Too Well</em></span> years ago, when she penned the original track. While some seem like more recent additions, like specific lines about her age, the new version of the song features some especially raw lyrics Taylor chose not to include on the 2012 track.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">The first change is in the second verse, where Tay sings:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><em>“And you were tossing me the car keys, ‘f--k the patriarchy’<br></em><em>Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town<br></em><em>And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now<br></em><em>He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was<br></em></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><em>'Til we were dead and gone and buried<br></em><em>Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same<br></em><em>After three months in the grave<br></em><em>And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you<br></em><em>But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame”</em></p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">First of all, ouch. Second of all, these lines seem to tie into a pretty popular fan theory that Jake tried to rekindle his and Taylor’s romance a few months after initially calling things off in 2011. Though the theory doesn’t have much evidence to back it up, it wouldn’t be the first time Tay has sung about an ex trying to come crawling back - <em>We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, Anyone?</em> And yep, that one hurts too! It’s believed these lines refer to Taylor’s ex (looking at you Jake) wanting to keep their relationship a secret, while she was totally committed to the romance.</p>
        <img src="./taylorswift_256365684_2621213551357210_1029018913874095019_n.jpg" alt="" class="sadie">
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">One of the biggest changes in the 10-minute version is after the bridge, where Taylor just goes in on her ex with these emotionally charged lines:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><em>“They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell<br></em><em>Every time you double-cross my mind<br></em><em>You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine<br></em><em>And that made me want to die</em></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><em>The idea you had of me, who was she?<br></em><em>A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you<br></em><em>Not weeping in a party bathroom<br></em><em>Some actress asking me what happened, you<br></em><em>That's what happened, you</em></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"><em>You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes<br></em><em>Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show<br></em><em>But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come<br></em><em>And he said, ‘It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one’”</em></p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">If you weren’t crying already, this would be the section of the song that really turns the waterworks on. It’s also the section that fans believe proves the song is about Jake Gyllenhaal, specifically because of the references to an age gap and a birthday party. There’s a nine-year age gap between Jake and Taylor, who were 29 and 20 respectively when they dated – hence the line about being “closer in age”.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">It’s also a widely held belief among fans that Taylor knew the romance with Jake was over when he skipped her 21<sup>st</sup> birthday party, which would have been in December of 2010, right before the pair split. Not only did that experience (allegedly) inspire the track <em>The Moment I Knew</em>, it also seems to have inspired the lines in the new version of <em>All Too Well</em> about watching the door all night as the narrator turns 21.</p>
        <img src="./taylorswift_254916951_416929156603561_4218133791877832909_n.jpg" alt="">
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">Did we mention that Jake, who is 40, is currently dating a 25-year-old? And that he was photographed with her in Brooklyn in 2010? And that she and Jake are both fire signs, hence the whole “twin flame” thing? Okay, maybe that last one is a bit questionable, but the rest of the evidence stands. If there were any doubts about <em>All Too Well</em> being written about Jake Gyllenhaal, the 10-minute version has well and truly put them to bed.</p>

        <h2><span>‘All Too Well’ </span>Lyrics:</h2>
        <pre id="lyrics-style">
            
            I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys
Fuck The Patriarchy keychain on the ground
We were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down: Any time now
He's gonna say it's love
You never called it what it was

Till we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing, it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece till you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well
But I'm in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
Maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened: You
That's what happened: You

You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night
Willin' you to come
And he said: It's supposed to be fun
Turning 21

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us (just between us) I remember it all too well (wind in my hair)
(I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)</pre>
